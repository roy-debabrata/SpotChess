# SpotChess
A simple chess engine. (Being) Written in Java. Currently don't intend to use opening or endgame bases. Let's see how far pure computation takes us.

# Request
This software contains some new algorithms. I wish to publish a paper on them. If you wish to do the same (and have experience with the process) 
consider working with me. If not, please do attribute (if any) novel ideas to me.

# Collaboration
For V1.0,  I am working extensively on performance improvements whether it be through new approaches or through optimization. I also am working on 
making the move generation process bug free by adding more tests. If you wish to contribute to the same/have any new ideas, please feel free to contact me.
